# Real Estate Tokenization Platform Architecture

## System Overview
A modular Flask-based platform enabling real estate stakeholders to tokenize properties and architectural elements using blockchain technology. The platform integrates Building Information Modeling (BIM) with smart contracts while ensuring regulatory compliance through AI-powered analytics.

## Target Users
- **Landlords & Property Owners**: Tokenize real estate assets
- **Architects**: Upload and validate BIM files
- **Contractors**: Access validated architectural plans
- **Investors**: Purchase tokenized property elements
- **Brokers**: Manage property listings and transactions

## Clean Architecture Implementation

### 1. Core Domain (Entities)
- **Property**: Represents real estate assets and architectural elements
- **Role**: Manages stakeholder access control
- **TokenizedAsset**: Handles blockchain-registered property elements
- **BudgetAllocation**: Enforces payment distribution rules

### 2. Application Layer (Use Cases)
- Property Tokenization Service
- Compliance Validation Service
- Role-Based Access Control
- Budget Split Management

### 3. Interface Adapters
- RESTful Controllers
- Storage Gateways
- Blockchain Integration
- LLM Analytics Service

### 4. External Interfaces
- Web UI (Flask/Jinja2)
- Database Layer
- File Storage System
- Smart Contract Interface

## Key Features

### 1. BIM Integration
- Support for IFC/DWG file formats
- Decentralized storage for architectural files
- Version control and audit trails

### 2. Blockchain Integration
- Smart contract deployment for tokenized assets
- Automated budget split enforcement
- Transaction logging and verification
- Keplr wallet integration for signing transactions
- Ithaca-1 chain integration for the Cosmos ecosystem

### 3. Compliance & Analytics
- AI-powered safety regulation validation
- Automated code compliance checks
- Real-time budget allocation analysis

### 4. User Interface
- Role-based dashboards
- Contract visualization
- Real-time analytics display
- File upload and validation interface

## Technical Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask (Python 3.11+)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login
- **Form Handling**: Flask-WTF
- **Blockchain**: CosmPy for Cosmos SDK integration

### Frontend
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2
- **Styling**: Bootstrap (Dark Theme)
- **Icons**: Feather Icons (bundled locally)
- **Charts**: Chart.js
- **UI Components**: Custom Flask components

### Storage
- BIMserver for BIM file management and model-driven architecture
- Local file system as fallback storage (MVP)
- PostgreSQL for application data
- Blockchain for asset tokenization
- Structured JSON data storage for contracts

### Analytics
- Custom LLM implementation for compliance checks
- Keyword-based safety analysis
- Real-time validation feedback
- Blockchain transaction analysis

## Security Features
- Role-based access control
- Secure file upload validation
- Input sanitization
- Session management
- Database connection pooling
- Error handling and logging

## API Endpoints

### File Management
```
POST /upload - Upload BIM files
GET  /files  - Retrieve file list
```

### Contract Management
```
POST /tokenize  - Create new token
GET  /contracts - List active contracts
```

### Analytics
```
POST /validate    - Validate BIM compliance
GET  /analytics   - Retrieve property insights
```

## BIMserver Integration

The platform integrates with BIMserver, a model-driven architecture for BIM data management.

### Architecture
- **Factory Pattern**: `StorageFactory` creates the appropriate storage gateway based on configuration
- **Gateway Interface**: Common interface for `LocalStorageGateway` and `BIMServerGateway`
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Automatically falls back to local storage if BIMserver is unavailable

### Features
- Project and revision management for BIM files
- Advanced model querying and validation
- Version control for architectural models
- Multi-user collaboration support
- Format conversion (IFC, XML, JSON)

### Benefits
- Improved model quality through validation services
- Enhanced collaboration between stakeholders
- Better version control for complex architectural models
- Advanced querying capabilities for model data
- Integration with industry-standard BIM tools

## Future Enhancements
1. **BIMserver Query Language**: Advanced model interrogation
2. **IPFS Integration**: Decentralized file storage
3. **Cosmos SDK**: Full blockchain integration
4. **Advanced LLM**: GPT-4/Llama 3 integration
5. **Multi-chain Support**: Cross-chain compatibility
6. **Advanced Analytics**: ML-based property valuation

## Development Guidelines
- Clean Architecture principles
- Type hints and documentation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Modular component design
- Test-driven development approach

This architecture ensures:
- Scalability through modular design
- Maintainability via clean architecture
- Security through role-based access
- Reliability via comprehensive error handling
