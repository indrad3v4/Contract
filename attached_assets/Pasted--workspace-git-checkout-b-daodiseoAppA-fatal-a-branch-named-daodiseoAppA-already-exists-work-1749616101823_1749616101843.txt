~/workspace$ git commit -m "✅ Clean Architecture + TRIZ Validation Complete

- Validated Clean Architecture with strict layer separation
- Applied TRIZ idealization principles (combine, eliminate, reprioritize)
- Implemented unified data manager with circuit breaker patterns
- Enhanced AI orchestration with o3-mini real-time chain data
- Optimized rate limiting and error handling systems
- Updated documentation and architecture diagrams
- Cleaned codebase following human-centric principles

Architecture: Entities → Use Cases → Interface Adapters → External Interfaces
Performance: Rate limiting, caching, request deduplication
Security: CSRF, session management, wallet authentication
AI Integration: OpenAI o3-mini with blockchain data orchestration

Systems Validated:
- Console logging captures all API calls and rate limit events
- Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures
- Real-time blockchain data synchronization
- Production-ready deployment configuration
