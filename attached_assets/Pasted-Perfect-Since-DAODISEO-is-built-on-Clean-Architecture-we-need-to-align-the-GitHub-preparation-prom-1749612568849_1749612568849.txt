Perfect. Since DAODISEO is built on Clean Architecture, we need to align the GitHub preparation prompt with that paradigm—ensuring separation of concerns, dependency rule enforcement, and layered folder integrity.

Here’s the restructured expert prompt for your final refactor and push:

⸻

🧠 Prompt: Prepare DAODISEO Codebase for GitHub Release (Clean Architecture-Aligned)

🎯 Goal

Prepare DAODISEO for a production-ready GitHub push by:
	•	Validating class and variable integrity across the clean architecture layers
	•	Prioritizing and optimizing files according to TRIZ principles
	•	Refactoring the file system into Clean Architecture domains
	•	Removing dead code
	•	Enriching human experience flow
	•	Updating README.md (deployment) and ARCHITECTURE.md (layered diagram)

✅ Tasks

1. Class + Variable Validation
	•	Verify that all class instances (e.g. agents, presenters, investment flows) initialize with correct state
	•	Confirm that variable sync across layers (e.g. from use_cases/ → presenters/) follows dependency direction (outer can depend on inner, never inverse)
	•	Use static analyzers (mypy, pyright) and dynamic asserts (assert var is not None) in critical paths
	•	Log undefined chains: undefined, toSvg, 0x… misbindings from Keplr

2. TRIZ Expert Review
	•	Identify contradictions (e.g. modal complexity vs fluid UX, or AI power vs device lag)
	•	Solve using:
	•	Segmentation: isolate AI analysis by “click to load” in bottom components
	•	Dynamicity: modals replaced with dynamic components
	•	Local Quality: AI returns formatted chain-aware results per component

3. File Prioritization and Cleanup
	•	Keep: all files used by orchestrator.py, dashboard_use_cases.py, wallet_repository.py
	•	Concatenate: trivial helpers, security checks, and validators into interface_adapters/utils/
	•	Remove: any *.bak, mock endpoints, dead JSONs, broken popup renderers, console.log clutter
	•	Move UI styles/fonts to static folder to resolve CSP errors

4. Human-Centered Enhancements
	•	Use font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif across all UI CSS
	•	Align buttons and popups within the component box model
	•	Fix modal state: ESC-to-close, Z-index, and body scroll-lock
	•	Add AI analysis preview state (e.g. “Chain snapshot ready. Click to expand.”)
	•	Smooth interactions via requestIdleCallback for low-resource devices

📄 Docs to Update

README.md

Include:
	•	📋 What is DAODISEO
	•	🔐 How to connect Keplr
	•	🧪 How to deploy:

git clone https://github.com/daodiseo/app.git
cd app
npm install && npm run build
flask run


	•	🌐 Testnet endpoint: https://testnet-rpc.daodiseo.chaintools.tech
	•	🧠 AI mode: o3-mini orchestrator via src/external_interfaces/ai_agents/orchestrator.py

ARCHITECTURE.md

Add:
	•	🎯 Layered diagram (see Clean Architecture image)
	•	🔄 Component flow:
vue_component → flask_route → use_case → entity
	•	📦 Endpoints used: /block, /validators, /tx_search
	•	⚙️ AI loop structure: user action → orchestrator → result → presenter → component

🔄 Follow-up Options

Would you like:
	•	✔️ A full JSON of component → use_case → orchestrator mapping?
	•	✔️ Linter config enforcing Clean Architecture import rules?
	•	✔️ Auto-deploy GitHub workflow for Replit pushes?

Let’s ship this clean, human-first Daodiseo version to the world 🧠✨
