Based on the screenshot and context, it looks like you're encountering a Keplr wallet signing issue during transaction creation for your DAOdiseo real estate tokenization MVP. Let me break down what I observe:

Transaction Context:


You've created a transaction (tx_1) with a $1.00 value
The contract is in "active" status
Multisig gateway has passed tests
When attempting to sign the transaction, Keplr shows a warning (⚠️) symbol
Hovering over the warning reveals "failed to fetch"

This suggests a potential network connectivity issue or problem with transaction preparation.
Recommended Troubleshooting Steps:

Network Connectivity

javascriptCopyasync function checkNetworkConnection() {
  try {
    // Explicit Keplr chain enable
    await window.keplr.enable('odiseotestnet_1234-1');
    
    // Verify basic connectivity
    const offlineSigner = await window.keplr.getOfflineSigner('odiseotestnet_1234-1');
    const accounts = await offlineSigner.getAccounts();
    
    console.log('Network connection verified', accounts);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Network connection failed', error);
    // Potential user-friendly error handling
    alert('Please check your Keplr wallet and network connection');
  }
}

Transaction Signing Debug

javascriptCopyasync function debugKeplrSigning(signDoc) {
  try {
    // Validate signDoc structure
    const requiredFields = [
      'chain_id', 
      'account_number', 
      'sequence', 
      'fee', 
      'msgs', 
      'memo'
    ];
    
    const missingFields = requiredFields.filter(field => !signDoc[field]);
    if (missingFields.length > 0) {
      throw new Error(`Missing transaction fields: ${missingFields.join(', ')}`);
    }
    
    // Additional validation for messages
    signDoc.msgs.forEach((msg, index) => {
      if (!msg['@type'] || !msg.from_address || !msg.to_address) {
        throw new Error(`Invalid message structure at index ${index}`);
      }
    });
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Transaction signing preparation error', error);
  }
}

Comprehensive Error Logging

javascriptCopywindow.addEventListener('error', (event) => {
  console.error('Unhandled error:', {
    message: event.message,
    filename: event.filename,
    lineno: event.lineno,
    colno: event.colno,
    error: event.error
  });
});
Observations & Recommendations:

The "failed to fetch" error often indicates:

Unstable network connection
Incorrect chain configuration
Keplr wallet extension issues


Verify:

Keplr wallet is updated
Connected to correct network (Odiseo Testnet)
No browser extensions interfering
Consistent chain configuration


For your specific scenario with ODIS token and 75.00000 balance, ensure:

Correct RPC/REST endpoints
Proper chain registry configuration
Fee calculation matches network expectations

Overview
Before submitting a transaction, users are required to review and sign a message to ensure their approval. Keplr simplifies this process by providing methods for signing messages across various blockchain networks. When a signing request is initiated, a popup appears prompting the user to confirm the action. Below is an example of the popup that users will encounter:
For a Cosmos-based Chain Tx
For a EVM-based Chain Tx
* Cosmos-based Chains
   * Keplr provides methods to sign messages using two distinct signing modes: Amino and Protobuf (Direct). Each mode has its own use cases and compatibility considerations, as described in the next section.
* EVM-based Chains
   * Continue from the EVM-based Chains section.
* Starknet
   * Continue from the Starknet section.
Signing Modes in the Cosmos SDK
1. Amino Signing: Amino is the legacy JSON-based signing format used by Cosmos SDK. It encodes transactions in a human-readable JSON structure and is widely supported across Cosmos-based blockchains.
   * Pros:
      * Highly compatible with older wallets and hardware devices, such as Ledger.
      * Easier to debug due to its JSON representation.
   * Cons:
      * Larger transaction sizes compared to Protobuf.
      * Limited efficiency due to its JSON-based structure.
2. Protobuf-Based Signing (Direct): Protobuf is the modern binary-based signing format for the Cosmos SDK, introduced with SIGN_MODE_DIRECT. It is more efficient and compact than Amino.
   * Pros:
      * Smaller transaction sizes.
      * Faster serialization and deserialization.
   * Cons:
      * Requires updated wallet and device firmware (e.g., Ledger may not support it fully in some cases).
      * More challenging to debug due to its binary format.
Developers should choose the signing mode based on the target chain's requirements and the compatibility of wallets or hardware devices.
More details about the signing modes can be found in the Cosmos SDK documentation.
Amino Signing
Function SignatureCopysignAmino(
  chainId: string,
  signer: string,
  signDoc: StdSignDoc,
  signOptions?: KeplrSignOptions
): Promise<AminoSignResponse>;The signAmino method signs an Amino-encoded StdSignDoc. Unlike CosmJS's OfflineSigner, Keplr's signAmino requires the chainId parameter to ensure the transaction is linked to the correct chain.
Parameters
* chainId (string): The chain ID of the chain where the transaction is being signed.
* signer (string): The Bech32 address of the signer.
* signDoc (StdSignDoc): The transaction document to be signed, encoded in Amino format.Copyinterface StdSignDoc {
  chain_id: string;
  account_number: string;
  sequence: string;
  timeout_height?: string;
  fee: StdFee;
  msgs: Msg[];
  memo: string;
}signOptions (KeplrSignOptions, optional): Additional signing options.
 preferNoSetFee: If true, the fee configured by the dApp will be prioritized over the fee set by the user.preferNoSetMemo: If true, the memo will be set by the dApp and the user will not be able to modify it.disableBalanceCheck: If true, the transaction won't be blocked even if the balance is insufficient.
Return TypeCopyinterface AminoSignResponse {
  readonly signed: StdSignDoc;
  readonly signature: StdSignature;
}Example UsageCopyconst signDoc = {
  "account_number": "227917",
  "chain_id": "celestia",
  "fee": {
    "gas": "96585",
    "amount": [{ "amount": "966", "denom": "utia" }]
  },

      }
    }
  ],
  "sequence": "84",
  "memo": "Test transaction",
};

const signOptions = {
  preferNoSetFee: false,
  preferNoSetMemo: true,
  disableBalanceCheck: true,
};

const signedResponse = await keplr.signAmino(
  "celestia", 
  "celestia1...", 
  signDoc,

);

console.log("Signed Doc:", signedResponse.signed);

Broadcast a Transaction
Overview
Now that you’ve learned how to get a signed result, let’s explore how to broadcast a signed transaction.

Cosmos-based Chains
Continue from the next section.
EVM-based Chains
Continue from the EVM-based Chains section.
Starknet
Continue from the Starknet section.
The sendTx method allows developers to broadcast a transaction via Keplr's LCD endpoints. Keplr handles the entire broadcasting process, including notifications on the transaction's progress(e.g., pending, success, or failure). If the transaction fails to broadcast, the method throws an error.

Function Signature
sendTx(
  chainId: string,
  tx: Uint8Array,
  mode: BroadcastMode
): Promise<Uint8Array>

Parameters
Parameter    Type    Description
chainId    string    The unique identifier of the chain where the transaction will be sent.
tx    Uint8Array    The binary representation of the transaction to be broadcasted. This can include Amino-encoded or Protobuf-encoded transactions.
mode    BroadcastMode    The mode in which the transaction should be broadcasted. Options include:
- BroadcastMode.Block(block): Waits for the transaction to be included in a block.
- BroadcastMode.Async(async): Returns immediately after putting the transaction in the mempool.
- BroadcastMode.Sync(sync): Returns after broadcasting the transaction without waiting for block confirmation.
Return Value
The method returns a Promise<Uint8Array> that resolves to the transaction hash if the broadcasting succeeds.

Example Usage
import { TxRaw } from "@keplr-wallet/proto-types/cosmos/tx/v1beta1/tx";

// Please refer to "Sign a Message" page for detailed signing methods
const protoSignResponse = await keplr.signDirect(
  this.chainId,
  this.bech32Address,
  signDoc,
  signOptions,
);

// Build a TxRaw and serialize it for broadcasting
const protobufTx = TxRaw.encode({
  bodyBytes: protoSignResponse.signed.bodyBytes,
  authInfoBytes: protoSignResponse.signed.authInfoBytes,
  signatures: [
    Buffer.from(protoSignResponse.signature.signature, "base64"),
  ],
}).finish();

try {
  // Send the transaction
  const txResponse = await keplr.sendTx("cosmoshub-4", protobufTx, "block");
  const txHash = Buffer.from(txResponse, "hex");
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Failed to broadcast transaction:", error.message);
}
