Based on the new error logs, I can see we've made progress but have now hit a specific implementation issue with the Cosmos SDK integration. The key error is:

```
ERROR in contract_controller: Failed to create blockchain transaction: 'LedgerClient' object has no attribute 'address'
```

This is a more specific error that's easier to fix. Let me draft a prompt for resolving this issue:

# Prompt: Fix Cosmos SDK Integration in RE Tokenizer Application

## Issue Description
The application now successfully processes file uploads and budget split data, but fails when attempting to create the blockchain transaction with the error: `'LedgerClient' object has no attribute 'address'`.

## Root Cause Analysis
The error occurs when trying to access `client.address()` but the LedgerClient class doesn't have this method. This indicates an API mismatch between our code and the Cosmos SDK client library we're using.

## Specific Tasks Needed
1. Fix the blockchain transaction creation process in the contract_controller.py file
2. Correctly access the wallet address from the LedgerClient object
3. Ensure proper Cosmos SDK integration with current library versions

## Implementation Details
1. Check the LedgerClient API documentation for the correct method to get the address
2. Update the contract_controller.py code to use the correct method
3. If needed, add proper initialization for the LedgerClient object
4. Add appropriate error handling for SDK interactions

## Code Changes Needed
1. In the contract_controller.py file, locate where we call `client.address()`
2. Replace it with the correct method, likely one of:
   - `client.get_address()`
   - `client.wallet.address`
   - `client.account_address`
3. Ensure that the client is properly initialized with wallet information
4. Add debug logging to verify the correct address is being used

## Testing Strategy
1. Test with various configuration options for the Cosmos client
2. Verify wallet initialization process
3. Ensure the correct chain ID is being used
4. Test in test mode first before connecting to a real network

## Expected Outcome
A successful transaction creation process that can access the wallet address and submit the transaction to the blockchain network, resulting in a valid token being created for the uploaded BIM file.

## References
1. Check the Cosmos SDK documentation for the correct client usage
2. Review any example code for working with the LedgerClient
3. Verify that we're using the correct SDK version that matches our implementation
