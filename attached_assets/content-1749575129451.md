In this article, we will implement a frosted glass effect using the bootstrap 4 card class. The below image is the final output that you will get as the final result of this article.

**Approach:**

**1\. Styling the body:**

Let's first set the background for your webpage. Write the below code under your head tag inside your <style> tag. If you have already set your background property (which you would have) then skip to the next section. If not, here you go.

CSS`
body {
     background-image: url('background.jpg');
     background-repeat: no-repeat;
     background-size: 100%;
     background-attachment: fixed;
}
`

#### [You can read about the above properties here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-background)

**2\. Frost glass card:**

Under the style tag, use the following code,

CSS`
.card {
      box-shadow: 0 0 5px 0 ;
      background: inherit;
      backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
      <!--margin: 100px; according to your need-->
}
`

So what do we have here,

- [**box-shadow**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-box-shadow-property) **:** This property is used to give a shadow-like effect to the frames of an element.
- [**background**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-background) **:** Use this to make the element transparent and have the same background as your webpage (in the body class its necessary to have "background-attachment: fixed,")
- [**backdrop-filter**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-backdrop-filter-property) **:** Use this to apply effects to the area behind an element. ( [Read this as well](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/workaround-to-backdrop-filter-in-css)) Basically, this is the property that is reducing a lot of CSS styling here.
- [**margin**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-margins-padding) **:** Margin and padding are according to your need.

**Note:** There have been issues with Mozilla's browser Firefox and in cases, the backdrop-filter doesn't work properly, chrome and edge work fine.

**3\. <div> in body:**

HTML`
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="card card-body" style="justify-content: center;">
            <!--Contents <h1 >_______</h1> -->
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
`

**Final Code:**

HTML`
<!DOCTYPE html>

            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-size: 100%;
            background-attachment: fixed;
        }

        h1 {
            color: white;
            height: 250px;
            display: flex;

            align-items: center;
        }

        .card {

            box-shadow: 0 0 5px 0;
            background: inherit;
