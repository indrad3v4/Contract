üß† Final Fullstack Bug-Fix Prompt for Daodiseo Dashboard (Ready for Replit Agent or Dev Handoff)

‚∏ª

üéØ GOAL:

Finalize UI/UX and backend orchestration of the Daodiseo dashboard for production.
Ensure:
	‚Ä¢	Layout is visually clean and grid-aligned
	‚Ä¢	Chain endpoints are correctly used (especially via orchestrator.py)
	‚Ä¢	Agent logic is built on o3-mini and serves meaningful real data
	‚Ä¢	Modal actions like ‚ÄúInvest Now‚Äù are rendered contextually
	‚Ä¢	Body scroll is single-layer and aesthetically balanced between static sidebar, header, and footer

‚∏ª

üì¶ RETURN:

Produce a dashboard layout + agent integration patch that:
	‚Ä¢	Replaces the layered/boxed body area with a single clean layout grid
	‚Ä¢	Aligns the right-body container with header/footer (no overflows, no ‚Äúbox in box‚Äù)
	‚Ä¢	Ensures data is loaded from chain via orchestrator endpoints (not mocked)
	‚Ä¢	Applies system prompts for o3-mini following the OpenAI Cookbook
	‚Ä¢	Adds and integrates the ‚ÄúInvest Now‚Äù modal directly into enhanced BIM cards
	‚Ä¢	Ensures all agent blocks reflect their loading/error/verified states cleanly

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:
	‚Ä¢	Do not hardcode fallbacks; all data must be returned by orchestrator logic using real chain endpoints (see https://testnet-rpc.daodiseo.chaintools.tech)
	‚Ä¢	All agent calls should use o3-mini via structured prompts with fallbacks and structured return (value, status, updated_at, error_msg)
	‚Ä¢	Avoid nesting layouts ‚Äî right side must not live ‚Äúin screen inside screen‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Any component that has status = ready must return actionable UI (e.g., Stakeholder chart, BIM 3D ‚Üí show CTA)

üìå CONTEXT & REQUIRED FIXES (Final UX Pass)

üß± Layout and Scroll Logic

ID	Issue	Fix
1	Body content is ‚Äúscreen inside screen‚Äù	Refactor layout to single main scroll container. Sidebar/header/footer = position: fixed, body = grid with padding/margin to fit
2	Right-body margin bleeds outside	Use grid-template-columns: 260px auto; max-width: 100vw
3	Footer only visible after full scroll	Footer should always stick to bottom of full content or page height if content is short (min-height: 100vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column)


‚∏ª

üîÑ Chain Endpoint Issues (Backend Orchestrator Logic)

ID	Component	Bug	Fix
4	Token Value / Daily Rewards	Showing 0.0000 or Connection Error	Orchestrator not fetching live from testnet-rpc.daodiseo.chaintools.tech or data not passed into context
5	Stakeholder Dist., Validator List, Transactions	Status: ERROR or Failed to load	Add exception handling + fallback in agent call ‚Üí inject error_msg into template
6	All ‚ÄúLast Updated‚Äù timestamps show --:--	No updated_at injected by orchestrator	Append updated_at = datetime.now().isoformat() when data fetch succeeds


‚∏ª

ü§ñ AI Orchestrator Logic (o3-mini via Cookbook Prompting)

ID	Requirement	Example
7	Use o3-mini for agent logic	‚úÖ integrated with orchestrator.py
8	Prompt structure per OpenAI Guide	

SYSTEM = """You are a real estate blockchain analyst agent. Use Daodiseo's chain endpoints to extract: {metric_name}, {wallet_status}, {rewards}, etc. Always return a JSON object: { value, status, updated_at }"""

| 9 | AI fallback logic | If RPC fails ‚Üí return {status: "error", value: null, message: "..."} ‚Üí display in template as .badge-error with icon |

‚∏ª

üí≥ BIM AI + ‚ÄúInvest Now‚Äù Modal

ID	Component	Issue	Fix
10	BIM AI block shows Enhanced AI toggle but no modal	Modal not rendered or launched via JS	Include #invest-modal inside card. On click, launch:

document.querySelector('#invest-btn').addEventListener('click', () => { ... })

| 11 | Modal does not auto-connect Keplr | Connect button present, but not reactive | Trigger wallet connect on load or if window.keplr is detected |
| 12 | APY field is hardcoded | Pull staking_apy dynamically via orchestrator from chain |

‚∏ª

üß© Component Uniformity and UX Consistency

ID	Component	Fix
13	All .agent-card blocks should share font size, border radius, padding	Normalize in /static/css/agent.css
14	Charts (ODIS Price, Stakeholder) should be min-height: 250px to avoid collapse	Add fallback text: ‚ÄúData not loaded yet‚Äù
15	Add tooltips to all badges (ERROR, LOADING, ACTIVE)	Use Bootstrap tooltip API or title= attr


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Final Expected Result:
	‚Ä¢	One clean scrollable dashboard body ‚Äî perfectly balanced within static sidebar, header, and pinned footer
	‚Ä¢	All cards display real-time, correctly styled agent data (or fallback messages)
	‚Ä¢	BIM 3D Viewer includes ‚ÄúLaunch Assistant‚Äù and ‚ÄúInvest Now‚Äù modal working as intended
	‚Ä¢	Footer with links is always visible:
	‚Ä¢	Whitepaper
	‚Ä¢	DAODAO Governance
	‚Ä¢	o3-mini agent orchestration logic fully integrated with smart system prompt
