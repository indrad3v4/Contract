Looking at these DAODISEO.APP screenshots as a UI/UX expert, here are the major issues I see from top to bottom:

Navigation & Layout Issues

Inconsistent spacing: Uneven gaps between cards and sections throughout

Poor visual hierarchy: No clear reading order or information prioritization

Typography & Content Issues

Generic placeholder text: "Loading..." appears in critical data areas (Image 1)

Inconsistent text sizing: Mixed font weights and sizes without clear hierarchy

Poor contrast: Some text appears difficult to read against dark backgrounds

Unclear labeling: Technical jargon without user-friendly explanations

Data Visualization Problems

Confusing metrics: Numbers like "150,101M" and "148,505M" with unclear context

Pie chart without labels: Asset distribution chart needs better legend placement

Inconsistent status indicators: Multiple status types (ACTIVE, VERIFIED, PENDING) without clear meaning

Overwhelming data density: Too much information crammed into small spaces

Interactive Elements Issues

Button inconsistency: Different button styles and colors without clear purpose

Unclear CTAs: "Delegate" and "Details" buttons don't indicate their function clearly

Missing feedback: No clear indication of user's current location or actions

Dashboard Specific Problems

Information overload: Too many metrics without context or prioritization

Poor card design: Inconsistent card sizes and content alignment

Confusing navigation: Sidebar navigation doesn't clearly indicate current page

Mobile responsiveness concerns: Layout appears designed only for desktop

Trust & Credibility Issues

Verification badges: Overuse of "VERIFIED" status creates confusion about what's actually verified

Financial data presentation: Critical financial information lacks proper formatting and context

Error handling: No clear error states or loading indicators

Accessibility Concerns

Color-only communication: Status indicators rely heavily on color

Small touch targets: Buttons and interactive elements appear too small

Poor keyboard navigation: No visible focus indicators

The overall impression is of a complex financial platform that prioritizes showing data over helping users understand and act on it.
