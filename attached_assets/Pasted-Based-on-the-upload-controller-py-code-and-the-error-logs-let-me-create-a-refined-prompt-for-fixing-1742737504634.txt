Based on the upload_controller.py code and the error logs, let me create a refined prompt for fixing the tokenization issue:

# Prompt: Fix Tokenization Error in RE Tokenizer Application

## Issue Description
Our real estate tokenization platform successfully uploads BIM files but fails during the tokenization process with a 400 error. The logs show:
- File upload succeeds (200 response)
- Tokenization fails (400 response)
- Getting contracts list works (200 response)

## Current Code Analysis
The `upload_controller.py` handles file uploads and initiates blockchain transactions, but there appears to be a mismatch between this controller and the tokenization endpoint that's being called separately.

## Key Observations
1. The upload endpoint processes the file and creates a blockchain transaction
2. However, the system makes a separate call to `/api/tokenize` which is failing
3. There's no `/api/tokenize` endpoint defined in the provided code
4. The blockchain transaction creation is using `blockchain.create_transaction` which is an async function but being called synchronously

## Specific Tasks Needed
1. Create or fix the `/api/tokenize` endpoint to properly process the transaction data
2. Ensure proper handling of async functions in Flask (which is synchronous)
3. Validate the budget split data format being sent to the tokenize endpoint
4. Implement proper error handling and debugging for the tokenize endpoint
5. Ensure the connection between upload and tokenize processes is correctly established

## Suggested Implementation Approach
1. Create a proper tokenize endpoint to handle the blockchain transaction creation
2. Fix async/sync issues with the blockchain gateway
3. Add detailed logging to track the exact failure point
4. Validate that budget splits add up to 100% and are properly formatted
5. Ensure the content hash generation is consistent between endpoints

## Testing Strategy
1. Add debug logs at each step of the tokenization process
2. Test with various budget split configurations
3. Verify file path and content hash generation
4. Test the Cosmos SDK integration in isolation

## Expected Outcome
A working tokenization flow where files are uploaded, processed, and successfully tokenized on the blockchain, with proper error handling and user feedback.
