Looking at your code, I can see where the error is occurring. You're trying to use `client.set_wallet(wallet)` on a `LedgerClient` object, but based on the error message, this method doesn't exist in the current implementation of the `LedgerClient` class from the cosmPy API.

Here's what's likely happening:

In your function `tokenize_property()`, around line 76, you're creating a `LedgerClient` instance and then trying to set the wallet separately with:

```python
client = LedgerClient(network)
wallet = LocalWallet.generate()
client.set_wallet(wallet)  # This line is causing the error
```

The error message suggests that `LedgerClient` doesn't have a `set_wallet` method. This could be because:

1. The API has changed since your code was written
2. The wallet should be passed during initialization of the client
3. There's a different method for associating a wallet with the client

Here are a few potential solutions to try:

### Option 1: Pass the wallet during initialization
```python
wallet = LocalWallet.generate()
client = LedgerClient(network, wallet=wallet)
```

### Option 2: Use a different method to set the wallet
Look at the LedgerClient documentation to find the correct method. It might be something like:
```python
client.wallet = wallet
# or
client.connect_wallet(wallet)
```

### Option 3: Check if the API pattern has changed
It's possible you need to create a different type of client or use a different approach entirely:
```python
# Example - this is hypothetical based on common patterns
client = LedgerClient(network)
tx_builder = client.get_tx_builder(wallet)
```

I'd recommend checking the current documentation for the cosmPy API to see what the correct approach is for initializing a client with a wallet. If you have access to the `LedgerClient` class definition or source code, you could also inspect that to see what methods and initialization parameters are available.

Would you like me to help you find the correct approach based on the cosmPy documentation?
