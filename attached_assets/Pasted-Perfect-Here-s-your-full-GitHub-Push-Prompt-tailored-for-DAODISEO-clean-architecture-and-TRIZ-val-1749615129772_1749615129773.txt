Perfect. Here’s your full GitHub Push Prompt tailored for DAODISEO, clean architecture, and TRIZ validation, ready to run inside a Replit agent or Claude/GPT-4 to prep your daodiseoAppA branch push:

🔧 GITHUB PUSH PROMPT (CLEAN ARCHITECTURE + TRIZ VALIDATION)

You're acting as a full-stack AI architect preparing DAODISEO.APP for GitHub deployment in the `daodiseoAppA` branch. 

Enforce Clean Architecture based on the canonical model:

Entities → Use Cases → Interface Adapters → External Interfaces

Validate and clean the codebase by running these actions:

---

### 🧪 1. VALIDATE OBJECTS + FLOW

- Ensure all Python `class` instances (Wallet, Token, Property, etc.) are:
  - Properly instantiated
  - Consistently injected (no hardcoding in Flask routes or templates)
  - Used only in their correct architecture layer
- Check all variables passed between layers (e.g. orchestrator → dashboard → components) are synced and not redefined.
- Flag unused or broken logic in any `/service`, `/gateway`, or `/repository` file.

---

### 🧠 2. APPLY TRIZ IDEALIZATION

Use TRIZ principles to review the codebase as a system:

- **Combine**: Support scripts that can be merged into valuable core files? (e.g. `wallet_service.py` + `wallet_repository.py`)
- **Eliminate**: Remove/flag stale branches, broken test files, orphaned scripts, or UI routes that no longer serve UX
- **Reprioritize**: Rank files/modules by criticality to clean user experience and AI-driven orchestration
- **Human-centricity**: Rewrite any unclear variable names, module names, and comments that would confuse new contributors

---

### 📁 3. ENFORCE FOLDER STRUCTURE

Refactor folders into this strict hierarchy (if needed):

src/
├── entities/                  # Token, Validator, Property models
├── use_cases/                # tokenize_property.py, dashboard_use_cases.py
├── interface_adapters/       # Repositories: wallet, BIM
├── external_interfaces/      # Flask routes, dashboard controller
├── services/
│   ├── ai/                   # orchestrator.py (o3-mini)
│   ├── chain/                # blockchain_gateway.py, cosmos_gateway.py
│   └── security/            # security_utils.py
├── static/                   # Fonts, CSS
├── templates/                # Jinja views (if any)
└── main.py, app.py, config.py

---

### 📚 4. UPDATE README.md

Generate a README that includes:
- Clean description of DAODISEO (1-paragraph overview)
- Diagram/description of Clean Architecture structure
- How to run locally in Replit
- How to push to GitHub
- How to access testnet endpoints (e.g. https://testnet-rpc.daodiseo.chaintools.tech)

---

### 🧱 5. UPDATE architecture.md

Generate an updated `architecture.md` that includes:
- Folder-by-folder description of all layers
- How AI orchestrator fetches and syncs real-time blockchain data
- How wallet connection, token investment, validator queries flow through the system

---

### 🚀 6. GIT CLEANUP + PUSH

Once validated:
- Keep only `daodiseoAppA` and optionally `replit-sync-clean`
- Delete stale branches like:
  - `codex/replace-mode-values-with-cosmos-enum`
  - `codex/update-broadcasttransaction-logic`
  - `latest-deployment-fixes`
- Use this command flow to push:

```bash
git checkout daodiseoAppA
git add .
git commit -m "✅ Cleaned up architecture, validated TRIZ model, synced components, updated README"
git push origin daodiseoAppA


⸻

🛠️ BONUS CHECK (Optional)

Check for:
	•	Fonts: Replace Google Fonts with Helvetica or local fallback to avoid CSP violation
	•	RPC 429 Errors: Apply delay or cache for endpoints like /validators, /status, /tx_search

⸻

End goal: ✅ DAODISEO is pushed in perfect clean architecture shape, TRIZ-validated, lightweight, and human-readable.
