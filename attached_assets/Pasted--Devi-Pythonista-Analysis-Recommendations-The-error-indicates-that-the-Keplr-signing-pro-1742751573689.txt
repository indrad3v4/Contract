**Devi Pythonista 🏗️ – Analysis & Recommendations**

The error indicates that the Keplr signing process encountered an unexpected failure during the signature request. Although the error object is empty (`Error {}`), common causes for this include:

1. **Incompatible Signing Mode:**  
   - Keplr supports different signing methods (Amino vs. Direct). For example, Ledger accounts typically only support SIGN_MODE_AMINO. If your dApp is requesting SIGN_MODE_DIRECT (the default for many CosmJS transactions), this may cause an error.  
   - **Recommendation:** Try forcing Amino signing by using `getOfflineSignerOnlyAmino(chainId)` or adjusting your signing options in the Keplr integration.

2. **Chain Configuration Issues:**  
   - Ensure that the chain configuration (chain ID, RPC/REST endpoints, currency settings, etc.) passed to Keplr is correct. An incorrect chain suggestion or misconfigured parameters can lead to signing errors.
   - **Recommendation:** Verify your chain parameters against the [Keplr Docs – Use with CosmJS](https://docs.keplr.app/api/use-with/cosmjs) and the [Suggest Chain documentation](https://docs.keplr.app/api/guide/suggest-chain).

3. **Keplr Extension State:**  
   - Sometimes, Keplr may not be fully initialized or may have caching issues. It’s a good idea to clear advanced cache/cookies or ensure that the extension is updated.
   - **Recommendation:** Follow the troubleshooting steps in the [Keplr Advanced Troubleshooting Guidelines](https://help.keplr.app/articles/advanced-troubleshooting-guidelines).

4. **Multi-Signature Flow & Role Handling:**  
   - Since you’re implementing a multi-signature process with roles (owner, contributor, validator), ensure that each role’s signing request is correctly formatted and that the signing process for each role is executed in the expected order.
   - **Recommendation:** Add detailed logging and verify that the sign document (including fee, sequence, account number, and chain ID) is correct for each role before calling the signing function.

### **Next Steps:**

- **Force Amino Signing (if applicable):**
  ```javascript
  const offlineSigner = window.getOfflineSignerOnlyAmino(chainId);
  ```
  This might resolve issues if your account requires Amino signing.

- **Validate Chain Parameters:**  
  Cross-check your network configuration (chain id, RPC, REST, currencies) with the parameters required by Keplr as documented in the [Keplr Docs – Use with CosmJS](https://docs.keplr.app/api/use-with/cosmjs).

- **Troubleshoot Extension State:**  
  Clear your browser’s advanced cache and cookies, enable Developer Mode on your extensions page, and ensure your Keplr extension is up to date as suggested in the [Keplr Advanced Troubleshooting Guidelines](https://help.keplr.app/articles/advanced-troubleshooting-guidelines).

- **Test with Different Roles:**  
  If possible, simulate signing with different roles separately to isolate whether the error occurs for a specific role (e.g., only on the “contributor” signing request).
