I can see more details from the error logs you've shared. This gives us important information about what's going wrong with your transaction signing process.

The key error is:
```
"error": "Failed to get account data: <_InactiveRpcError of RPC that terminated with:
    status = StatusCode.PERMISSION_DENIED
    details = "Received http2 header with status: 403"
```

This is a critical issue - the system is getting a 403 Forbidden error when trying to access the RPC endpoint for the Odiseo testnet. This explains why you're getting empty account data, which then causes the signing process to fail.

Here's what you should focus on fixing:

1. **RPC Endpoint Access Issue:**
   - The 403 error indicates that your backend doesn't have permission to access the testnet RPC endpoint
   - This could be due to:
     - Incorrect RPC URL
     - Missing authentication credentials if the endpoint requires them
     - IP restrictions on the RPC endpoint

2. **Follow-up Prompt for Replit LLM:**

```
I've identified the specific issue with our account data retrieval. We're getting a 403 Forbidden error when trying to access the RPC endpoint:

"Failed to get account data: <_InactiveRpcError of RPC that terminated with: status = StatusCode.PERMISSION_DENIED details = "Received http2 header with status: 403""

Please provide:

1. Updated backend code that properly connects to the Odiseo testnet RPC endpoint:
   - Check if we need authentication or specific headers
   - Provide fallback RPC endpoints if available
   - Add proper error handling for connection issues

2. A simple test function that verifies RPC connectivity and retrieves account data properly

3. Updated frontend code that handles RPC connectivity issues gracefully

Remember that the chain ID is "odiseotestnet_1234-1" and we're using the address format "odiseo1..."
```

This problem suggests that access to the blockchain RPC endpoint is the fundamental issue blocking your progress. Once you fix the RPC connection issues, you should be able to proceed with fixing the sign doc creation and Keplr integration.
