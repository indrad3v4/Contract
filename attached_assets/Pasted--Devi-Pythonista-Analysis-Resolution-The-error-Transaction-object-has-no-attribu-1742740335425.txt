The error:

```
'Transaction' object has no attribute 'messages'
```

indicates that our code is trying to directly access or manipulate a non-existent `messages` attribute on the `Transaction` object. In the cosmpy (or Cosmos SDK-based) workflow, transactions are usually built using specific methods provided by the SDK rather than directly manipulating attributes.

---

### **Steps to Resolve:**

1. **Use the Correct API for Adding Messages:**
   - Instead of doing:
     ```python
     tx.messages.append(tx_msg)
     ```
     use the provided method:
     ```python
     tx.add_message(tx_msg)
     ```
   - This is the proper way to add a message to a transaction object, as it encapsulates any necessary logic.

2. **Review the SDK Documentation:**
   - Confirm the correct usage of the `Transaction` class and its methods. Often, the SDK documentation will provide clear examples of how to build and sign transactions.
   - **Cosmpy Documentation:**  
     [Cosmpy GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmpy)
   - **Cosmos SDK Documentation:**  
     [Cosmos SDK - Building Modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/building-modules/module-manager)

3. **Adjust Your Transaction Building Code:**
   - Replace any direct attribute manipulation with the provided API calls.
   - For example, change:
     ```python
     tx.messages.append(tx_msg)
     ```
     to:
     ```python
     tx.add_message(tx_msg)
     ```
   - This method call correctly integrates the message into the transaction, ensuring it is included during signing and broadcasting.

4. **Test the Transaction Creation:**
   - After making the change, run your tests (preferably using your pytest suite) to confirm that the transaction is constructed without errors.
   - Verify that the blockchain transaction appears as expected in the testnet explorer widget:

- **Cosmos SDK Documentation:**  
  [Cosmos SDK - Module Manager](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/building-modules/module-manager)

- **Cosmos Transactions & Signing Documentation:**

By using `tx.add_message(tx_msg)` instead of directly appending to a non-existent `messages` attribute, you‚Äôll align with the correct API usage provided by the SDK. This change should resolve the error and allow your tokenization transactions to be created and broadcast successfully.
