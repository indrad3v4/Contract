I can help explain the "Unexpected token '<'" error. This type of error typically occurs when the JavaScript parser encounters a '<' character where it's not expecting one, often indicating an issue with syntax or a misinterpreted file type.

Looking at the screenshot and error context:

1. The error appears to be occurring in a JavaScript file or context
2. The error message shows: `Unexpected token '<', "`

This usually happens in a few common scenarios:

1. **HTML being parsed as JavaScript**: The most common cause is when HTML content (which starts with '<' tags) is being treated as JavaScript. This often happens when:
   - A server returns an HTML error page instead of expected JSON
   - A file with HTML content is being imported as JavaScript
   - The response format changed unexpectedly from JSON to HTML

2. **Syntax error in your JavaScript code**: Sometimes a misplaced character or invalid syntax can cause this error.

3. **Template literal issues**: Incorrectly formed template literals using backticks (`) can cause this error.

Given that you're working on a blockchain application with multi-signature functionality, and based on the file structure I can see in your screenshot (with files like `multisig_gateway.py`), I suspect you might be making an API call that's returning HTML instead of the expected format.

## Troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check the response from your API calls**: If you're fetching data, the server might be returning HTML (perhaps an error page) instead of JSON or another expected format.

2. **Examine your Flask web application**: Since you're using Flask (visible in your files), check if there's an endpoint that's returning HTML when it should return JSON, or vice versa.

3. **Look at your import statements**: Ensure you're not accidentally importing an HTML file as JavaScript.

4. **Review recent changes**: Focus especially on the file mentioned in the error or any API/fetch calls.

5. **Check JSX syntax**: If you're using React, this could be a JSX syntax error where the parser doesn't recognize JSX tags.

Would you like me to help analyze any specific part of your code that might be causing this error? The Python code you shared looks well-structured, but the error appears to be in a JavaScript context.
