DAODISEO UI/UX MODERNIZATION AGENT PROMPT

You are a senior UX/UI developer tasked with completely redesigning the DAODISEO real estate tokenization platform dashboard. The current interface has severe usability problems that must be fixed immediately.

CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:
1. INFORMATION HIERARCHY DISASTER
Dashboard dumps all data at once (validators, tokens, AI brain, portfolio) without clear user flow
Users can't understand their primary goals: investment status, AI insights, or actions
No progressive disclosure or contextual navigation
2. AI BRAIN INTERACTION FAILURE
The central "AI BRAIN Neural Orchestrator" is decorative and non-functional
Users have no clear way to interact with AI for property analysis or insights
Missing conversational interface for BIM analysis and investment guidance
3. DATA VISUALIZATION PROBLEMS
Metrics are scattered meaningless numbers without context
No visual hierarchy showing what's important vs secondary information
Missing trend indicators, comparisons, and actionable insights
4. NAVIGATION CONFUSION
Sidebar navigation doesn't indicate current context or user journey
No breadcrumbs or clear path through complex workflows
Mobile responsiveness completely broken
IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
A. REDESIGN DASHBOARD LAYOUT
Create a role-based dashboard with clear user flows:

Investor view: Portfolio overview → Investment opportunities → AI insights
Developer view: BIM upload → Project management → Asset verification
Validator view: Staking dashboard → Network status → Rewards
B. IMPLEMENT CONVERSATIONAL AI INTERFACE
Replace the static AI brain with:

Chat-based interaction for property analysis
Quick action buttons for common tasks (portfolio analysis, market trends, risk assessment)
Context-aware responses based on user's current portfolio and activity
Integration with BIM data for intelligent property insights
C. MODERNIZE DATA VISUALIZATION
Create metric cards with proper visual hierarchy
Add trend indicators, percentage changes, and comparison data
Implement progressive disclosure for detailed information
Use color coding for status indicators (active/warning/success)
D. FIX NAVIGATION AND RESPONSIVE DESIGN
Implement smooth transitions between views
Add contextual breadcrumbs and navigation state
Create mobile-first responsive grid system
Add smart navigation that preserves user context
E. ENHANCE USER EXPERIENCE
Add micro-interactions and loading states
Implement real-time data updates without page refresh
Create onboarding flow for different user types
Add tooltips and contextual help
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
Use modern CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
Implement smooth animations and transitions (CSS transforms, opacity)
Create modular component architecture for scalability
Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
Optimize for performance with lazy loading and efficient DOM updates
SUCCESS METRICS:
Users can complete their primary task within 3 clicks
AI interaction provides actionable insights immediately
Dashboard loads and displays critical information in under 2 seconds
Mobile experience works seamlessly across all device sizes
Zero user confusion about navigation or current context
PRIORITY: Implement role-based progressive disclosure first, then conversational AI interface, followed by data visualization improvements.

Focus on user journey optimization over visual aesthetics - functionality and usability are paramount.
