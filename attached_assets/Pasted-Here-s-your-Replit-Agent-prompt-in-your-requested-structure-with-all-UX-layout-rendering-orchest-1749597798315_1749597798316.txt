🧠 Replit Agent Prompt – Dashboard Final Fixes

⸻

🎯 GOAL:

Fix all structural, visual, and agent orchestration issues in daodiseo.app dashboard using a clean grid layout, proper component rendering via orchestrator.py, and AI-driven logic built with the principles from OpenAI’s Agent Guide and the GPT-4.1 prompting cookbook.

Ensure:
	•	Sticky layout works (header + sidebar never move)
	•	Body scrolls independently and fits screen correctly
	•	All components load via AI agent endpoints
	•	Footer is always visible
	•	Visual system is unified (fonts, margins, states)

⸻

📦 RETURN:

A full system patch report listing:
	•	Layout fixes applied (sticky grid, scrollable main, no overflow)
	•	Components that now load data via endpoints from src/services/ai/orchestrator.py
	•	Visual consistency: shared classes for .agent-card, .agent-badge, etc.
	•	Footer added and pinned
	•	System prompt injected for o3-mini agent calls using OpenAI Prompting Guide

⸻

⚠️ WARNING:
	•	Do not break or override functional chain logic or real-time interactions from the Odiseo testnet endpoints.
	•	Preserve all working logic, modify only layout/fallback/rendering/view layer.
	•	Use real agent instructions based on “A Practical Guide to Building Agents” (PDF uploaded) to construct system prompts and handle agent-tool orchestration properly.
	•	Do not hardcode mock data—route everything through orchestrator functions using model o3-mini.

📌 CONTEXT: Critical Issues to Fix (as of final screenshots)

🧱 Layout & Positioning
	1.	Header scrolls away — should be position: fixed
	2.	Sidebar scrolls with page — should stay fixed
	3.	Body container moves beyond right screen edge — layout overflow
	4.	Footer only visible after scroll — should be pinned or always visible
	5.	Left and right grid columns misaligned — container mismatch
	6.	Page has no bottom breathing space — needs padding-bottom: 5rem

🧠 Agent Component Issues
	7.	ODIS Token shows Connection error — fallback works, but styling needs alignment
	8.	Daily Rewards, Total Reserves, etc. show 0 + loading — status logic mismatch
	9.	ODIS Price Chart displays correctly — ✅
	10.	BIM AI Assistant now loads — ✅ but needs clear fallback if empty
	11.	Stakeholder Distribution loads — ✅
	12.	Active Validators fail to load — fallback shown correctly, but style needs update
	13.	Cards like Token Value use different font size, spacing, and icon alignment — unify under .agent-card
	14.	All data components must be populated via orchestrator.py using endpoints, not mock logic

🧠 Agent Prompt Integration (from Agent Guide)
	15.	Use o3-mini model with structured prompt:

"You are a property intelligence agent. Use the Odiseo testnet chain endpoints to return structured data about {{metric_type}}. Return fields: value, status, updated_at, fallback_message."

	16.	Inject fallback instructions into system prompt for every card, using instructions= pattern from the OpenAI Agents SDK.

📎 Footer
	17.	Missing footer previously — now added, but ensure:

Whitepaper — https://whitepaper.daodiseo.app
DAODAO Governance — https://daodao.zone/dao/daodiseo

…are always visible on all screens.
