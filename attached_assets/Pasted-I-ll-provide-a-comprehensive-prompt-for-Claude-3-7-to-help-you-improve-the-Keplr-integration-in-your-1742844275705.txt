# DAOdiseo Keplr Integration Optimization Task

## Context
- Project: Real Estate Tokenization MVP (DDSmvp_v2.0)
- Current Issue: Intermittent "failed to fetch" error during Keplr transaction signing
- Goal: Implement comprehensive error handling and network verification

## Objectives
1. Create a robust Keplr wallet connection verification mechanism
2. Implement detailed error logging and diagnostics
3. Enhance transaction signing process with comprehensive validation
4. Add user-friendly error handling and recovery strategies

## Specific Focus Areas
- Network Connectivity Checks
- Transaction Signing Validation
- Error Logging and Reporting
- Fallback Mechanisms

## Recommended Implementation Strategy
1. Add network connectivity verification function
2. Create detailed transaction validation logic
3. Implement comprehensive error capture and logging
4. Design user-friendly error messaging
5. Add retry and fallback mechanisms

## Questions to Address
- How can we reliably detect and handle network disconnections?
- What are the most common failure points in Keplr transaction signing?
- How can we provide clear feedback to users about transaction issues?

Please review the existing code, identify potential improvements, and propose a robust implementation that enhances the reliability of our Keplr wallet integration.

Preferred Approach:
- Use TypeScript/JavaScript for frontend integration
- Leverage modern async/await patterns
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Focus on user experience and clear communication

Would you like me to start by reviewing the current implementation and suggesting specific improvements?
