CosmJS is the Swiss Army knife to power JavaScript based client solutions
ranging from Web apps/explorers over browser extensions to server-side clients
like faucets/scrapers in the Cosmos ecosystem.

"Cosm" is short for Cosmos and "JS" is short for _runs everywhere_ – we actually
develop in TypeScript.

## Documentation

[Permalink: Documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs#documentation)

[Here is a list of examples](https://gist.github.com/webmaster128/8444d42a7eceeda2544c8a59fbd7e1d9) using the Stargate package for use
with [Cosmos SDK 0.41](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.41.0) applications (like [gaia 4](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/v4.0.0)). Take a look at the wiki
page,
["What can CosmJS do for me?"](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/wiki/What-can-CosmJS-do-for-me%3F)
and various tests
( [ex](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/blob/main/packages/stargate/src/signingstargateclient.spec.ts))
for more example usage of the packages.

### API documentation

[Permalink: API documentation](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs#api-documentation)

The full API documentation is hosted at [cosmos.github.io/cosmjs](https://cosmos.github.io/cosmjs). This is a bit
tricky to navigate and requires basic TypeScript understanding. It is helpful if
you want to look up details for advanced use cases. This documentation is
auto-generated based on the current main branch and can occasionally diverge
from the latest release.

### Using custom Stargate modules

[Permalink: Using custom Stargate modules](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs#using-custom-stargate-modules)

Documentation on how to use your own custom modules with CosmJS for Stargate
chains (Cosmos SDK v0.41) can be found
[here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/blob/main/packages/stargate/CUSTOM_PROTOBUF_CODECS.md).

## Packages

[Permalink: Packages](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs#packages)

CosmJS is a library that consists of many smaller npm packages within the
[@cosmjs namespace](https://www.npmjs.com/org/cosmjs), a so-called monorepo.
Here are some of them to get an idea:

| Package | Description | Latest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [@cosmjs/stargate](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/blob/main/packages/stargate) | A client library for the Cosmos SDK 0.40+ (Stargate) | [![npm version](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ddcd312703d597c323487d06efc4c782739588daedf658de1fd383ab250cc8a5/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f6e706d2f762f40636f736d6a732f73746172676174652e737667)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmjs/stargate) |

### Modularity

[Permalink: Modularity](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs#modularity)

We're pretty proud of the modularity and a clean dependency tree in this
monorepo. This ensures software quality on our side and lets users pick exactly
what they need. Here you see how everything fits together (every item is a npm
package; right depends on left):

[![CosmJS dependency tree](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/raw/main/docs/cosmjs-tree.png)](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/blob/main/docs/cosmjs-tree.png)

If this was not enough to scare you away, check out the version including app
runtime dependencies: [cosmjs-tree-full.png](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/blob/main/docs/cosmjs-tree-full.png).

### Supported JS environments

[Permalink: Supported JS environments](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs#supported-js-environments)

Currently the codebase supports the following runtime environments:

1. Node.js 14+
2. Modern browsers (Chromium/Firefox/Safari, no Internet Explorer or
[Edge Spartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge#Development))
3. Browser extensions (Chromium/Firefox)

Our current JavaScript target standard is ES2020. We use WebAssembly to
implement certain cryptographic functions.

We're happy to adjust this list according to users' needs as long as you don't
ask for Internet Explorer support. If your environment does not support Wasm, we
can work on a solution with swappable implementations.

## Webpack Configs

[Permalink: Webpack Configs](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs#webpack-configs)

With WebPack 5, you have to be explicit about the usage of Node.js types and
modules that were simply replaced with re-implementations for browsers in
Webpack 4.

Configs for 0.28 and later:

```
module.exports = [\
  {\
    // ...\
    plugins: [\
      ...,\
      new webpack.ProvidePlugin({\
        Buffer: ["buffer", "Buffer"],\
      }),\
    ],\
    // ...\
    resolve: {\
      fallback: {\
        buffer: false,\
        crypto: false,\
        events: false,\
        path: false,\
        stream: false,\
        string_decoder: false,\
      },\
    },\
  },\
];
```

Configs for CosmJS < 0.28

```
module.exports = [\
  {\
    // ...\
    plugins: [\
      ...,\
      new webpack.ProvidePlugin({\
        Buffer: ["buffer", "Buffer"],\
      }),\
    ],\
    // ...\
    resolve: {\
      fallback: {\
        buffer: false,\
        crypto: false,\
        events: false,\
        path: false,\
        stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),\
        string_decoder: false,\
      },\
    },\
  },\
];
```

## Roadmap

[Permalink: Roadmap](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs#roadmap)

We maintain a [development board](https://github.com/orgs/cosmos/projects/6),
use [release milestones](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/milestones) and share
important updates in the [CosmWasm Community Call](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm/issues?q=label%3A%22Community+Call+%F0%9F%97%BA%F0%9F%93%9E%22). For higher level roadmap
discussion please reach out to the team.

## Known limitations

[Permalink: Known limitations](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs#known-limitations)

### 0.26

[Permalink: 0.26](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs#026)

1. When connecting to a Cosmos SDK 0.44+ backend, the verified queries from
`AuthExtension` and `BankExtension` as well as
`StargateClient.getAccountVerified` will fail because the storage keys are
not stable. Unverified queries can be used instead. Those queries are
deprecated now and will be removed in 0.27 ( [#910](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/910)).

### 0.25

[Permalink: 0.25](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs#025)

1. Decoding blocks of height 1 is unsupported. This is fixed in [#815](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/pull/815) and will
be released as part of CosmJS 0.26.

### 0.24

[Permalink: 0.24](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs#024)

1. `AuthExtension` and all higher level Stargate clients only support
`BaseAccount` s for all functionality, including getting account numbers and
sequences for transaction signing. This will be implemented for all common
Cosmos SDK account types in the 0.25 series.
