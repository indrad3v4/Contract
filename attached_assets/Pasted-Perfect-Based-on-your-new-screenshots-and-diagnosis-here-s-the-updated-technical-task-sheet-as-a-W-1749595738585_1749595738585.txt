Perfect. Based on your new screenshots and diagnosis, here’s the updated technical task sheet as a WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) for your dev-producer workflow.

This now includes:
	•	📐 Fixing the layout grid to fill the entire screen
	•	🧱 Making the header truly static + full-width
	•	🧠 Debugging component rendering issues for Token Value, Total Reserves, etc.
	•	🔄 Ensuring scroll visibility and content persistence in all dashboard agents

🧠 DAODISEO DASHBOARD LAYOUT & DATA PATCH

WBS | For Dev-Producer & Frontend Dev | v2 – Fullscreen, Sticky Header, Component Visibility

⸻

🎯 GOAL:

Make the entire dashboard layout fullscreen, ensure the header remains visible and aligned on scroll, and fix all visual bugs in dashboard components (Token Value, Total Reserves, etc.) that do not properly render or persist content.

⸻

🧱 GRID & LAYOUT TASKS (CSS / HTML / Bootstrap / Reflow)

#	Issue	Cause	Required Fix	UX Goal
1	📐 Main dashboard body doesn’t stretch full screen	Container nested in max-width wrapper or has overflow-hidden	Replace container with container-fluid. Set width: 100vw, min-height: 100vh, and use display: grid or flex to stretch main content	Dashboard fills browser window edge-to-edge
2	🧷 Header disappears on scroll	Header not position: sticky or z-index too low	In CSS: .header { position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 999; background: rgba(); }	Header stays pinned and doesn’t shift
3	📊 Dashboard components (cards) scroll out of view too early	overflow: hidden or nested scroll container active	Remove unnecessary scroll containers. Use body { overflow-y: scroll } instead of nested divs	User can scroll the full dashboard from top to bottom without cropped sections
4	🚧 “Screen inside screen” effect	Likely caused by body overflow, extra wrapper div, or fixed viewport	Remove overflow: hidden from any parent containers, especially on .main, .app, or .body-wrapper	Layout feels seamless, not boxed inside itself

📦 COMPONENT RENDERING TASKS (Frontend + Backend Context Injection)

#	Issue	Affected Component	Cause	Required Fix
5	🧠 Cards show Loading... or Error even when status = verified	Token Value, Total Reserves, Daily Rewards, etc.	Data agent may return partial or undefined values (e.g. value: null) while still marking as verified	In orchestrator.py, return both status + actual data.value. Do not set status = verified unless data is also present
6	❌ Token cards missing real data display even after scroll	Component not hydrated or rendered late	JS or Jinja is not reactive to new state, or cards not rerendered after scroll	Use observer pattern or Vue reactivity (if used). In Flask, inject values server-side correctly with:

{{ agent.value or "Awaiting data..." }}

| 7 | 📉 Cards don’t re-render after fetch/scroll | No DOM update cycle tied to API data | Bind fetch() → updateCard() → render() chain; OR add data-state="loading|verified|error" | Card visually updates as agent finishes fetching or user scrolls into view |

⸻

✅ UI SYSTEM RULES TO ENFORCE:
	•	All dashboard cards should:
	•	Show status badge (color-coded: green = verified, red = error, blue = syncing)
	•	Show value or fallback: Loading..., Awaiting update, or Offline
	•	Never scroll out or render blank once inside viewport
	•	Header should:
	•	Always stay visible (sticky/fixed)
	•	Fill entire horizontal space (100vw)
	•	Align with left panel pixel-perfectly
	•	Grid structure:

.app-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 260px auto;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr;
  grid-template-areas:
    "sidebar header"
    "sidebar main";
}


⸻

📋 FINAL CHECKLIST FOR DEV
	•	Remove scroll container nesting that causes dashboard to feel “in a screen”
	•	Convert .container → .container-fluid
	•	Make header sticky + aligned
	•	Fix all cards to load real data or fallback clearly
	•	Check all cards/components render on scroll
	•	Fix JS or Flask binding for agent data → visual component
	•	Add global loading + error UI states
