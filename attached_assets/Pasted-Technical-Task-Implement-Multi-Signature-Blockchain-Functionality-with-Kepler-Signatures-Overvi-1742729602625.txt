Technical Task: Implement Multi-Signature Blockchain Functionality with Kepler Signatures

‚∏ª

Overview:

Develop and integrate a blockchain module into the DAODISEO MVP codebase that uses Kepler wallet integration for signing transactions instead of a provided cosmos_mnemonic. This module must simulate a multi-signature process with three distinct roles: owner, contributor, and validator. The goal is to test blockchain transactions on the Cosmos testnet (via https://testnet.explorer.chaintools.tech/odiseo/widget) without requiring the project owner to share their cosmos_mnemonic.

Requirements:
	1.	Blockchain Integration Module:
	‚Ä¢	Multi-Signature Workflow:
	‚Ä¢	Design the module to require signatures from three distinct roles: owner, contributor, and validator.
	‚Ä¢	Instead of a single cosmos_mnemonic, implement a mechanism to simulate or capture signatures from Kepler wallets.
	‚Ä¢	Provide a test mode that mimics Kepler signatures, where each role‚Äôs signature is simulated, allowing end-to-end testing of the multi-sig process.
	‚Ä¢	Signature Abstraction:
	‚Ä¢	Abstract the signing process so that it can dynamically switch between test mode (using simulated Kepler signatures) and production mode (using actual Kepler wallet integration).
	‚Ä¢	Define clear interfaces for collecting signatures from each role and aggregating them into a single multi-sig transaction.
	2.	Endpoint Integration:
	‚Ä¢	/upload Endpoint:
	‚Ä¢	Modify the existing /upload endpoint so that when a file is uploaded, a blockchain transaction is created that requires multi-signature approval.
	‚Ä¢	The transaction should incorporate file metadata and relevant contract details.
	‚Ä¢	Root (/) Endpoint:
	‚Ä¢	Update the root endpoint to display the status and details of the blockchain contract.
	‚Ä¢	Integrate the testnet explorer widget (https://testnet.explorer.chaintools.tech/odiseo/widget) to visually confirm transaction details.
	3.	Testing & Validation (Pytest):
	‚Ä¢	End-to-End Test Cases:
	‚Ä¢	Create tests that simulate a file upload via /upload, trigger the multi-signature process using simulated Kepler signatures, and verify that the transaction is correctly registered on the testnet.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure that the multi-signature process only completes when all three roles have provided their signatures.
	‚Ä¢	Test that the contract details displayed on / reflect the correct status as seen on the explorer widget.
	‚Ä¢	Test Configuration:
	‚Ä¢	Provide a configuration flag or environment variable to toggle between test mode (simulated signatures) and production mode (Kepler integration).
	4.	Documentation:
	‚Ä¢	Document the new blockchain module, explaining:
	‚Ä¢	How multi-signature transactions are processed.
	‚Ä¢	How the system collects and aggregates signatures.
	‚Ä¢	How to run tests and switch between simulated and actual Kepler signing modes.
	‚Ä¢	Update the README with instructions for deploying and testing the blockchain functionality.

Deliverables:
	‚Ä¢	Updated Codebase:
	‚Ä¢	A blockchain module integrated into the DAODISEO MVP that supports multi-signature transactions.
	‚Ä¢	Modified /upload and / endpoints to incorporate blockchain functionality.
	‚Ä¢	Testing Suite:
	‚Ä¢	Comprehensive pytest tests covering:
	‚Ä¢	File upload and transaction creation.
	‚Ä¢	The multi-signature process (simulated via Kepler signatures for owner, contributor, and validator).
	‚Ä¢	Verification of contract display on the root endpoint.
	‚Ä¢	Documentation:
	‚Ä¢	Detailed documentation on module design, configuration, testing instructions, and steps to transition from test mode (simulated Kepler signatures) to production mode (actual Kepler wallet integration).

Outcome:

Upon successful completion, the DAODISEO MVP will:
	‚Ä¢	Allow file uploads to trigger blockchain transactions without needing a cosmos_mnemonic.
	‚Ä¢	Simulate multi-signature transactions using Kepler wallet signatures for three roles.
	‚Ä¢	Display the contract status accurately on the root endpoint and via the testnet explorer widget.
	‚Ä¢	Be fully testable using pytest, ensuring a reliable and secure blockchain integration ready for production.

This task ensures that blockchain functionality is implemented in a secure, role-based manner while aligning with project owner requirements and enabling full end-to-end testing without exposing sensitive mnemonic data.
