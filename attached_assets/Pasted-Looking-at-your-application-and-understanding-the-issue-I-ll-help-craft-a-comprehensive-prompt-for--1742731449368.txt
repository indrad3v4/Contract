Looking at your application and understanding the issue, I'll help craft a comprehensive prompt for implementing real data connectivity between your backend endpoints and frontend templates, specifically for displaying accurate contract data in the charts.

Here's a complete prompt that addresses your needs:

# Prompt: Connect Real Contract Data to Dashboard Charts in Flask Application

## Task Overview
I need to connect my Flask backend endpoints with frontend templates to display real contract data in the dashboard charts instead of the current static/placeholder data. The application is a real estate tokenization platform using blockchain technology with multi-signature support.

## Current Implementation
- The application uses Flask with Jinja2 templates
- The dashboard displays graphs/charts with placeholder data 
- The backend has working endpoints for contract data
- Multi-signature blockchain functionality is implemented
- Key files: `base.html`, `contracts.html`, `multisig_gateway.py`, `contract_controller.py`

## Requirements
1. Modify the backend endpoints to return real contract data in a format suitable for charts
2. Update the frontend templates to fetch and display this data
3. Ensure the charts accurately reflect:
   - Contract statuses (Pending Signatures, Active, Completed)
   - Recent transactions with correct values and dates
   - Budget allocations
4. Handle edge cases (no data, loading states, errors)

## Specific Technical Details
1. Create a new endpoint in `contract_controller.py` to aggregate contract metrics
2. Update the JavaScript in `base.html` to fetch data from this endpoint
3. Use proper error handling for API requests
4. Implement data refresh functionality
5. Use Chart.js data format for visualization

## Example Endpoint Structure
The API endpoint should return data structured like:
```json
{
  "contract_status": {
    "pending": 25,
    "active": 45,
    "completed": 30
  },
  "recent_transactions": [
    {
      "id": "tx_123",
      "status": "pending",
      "value": "25000",
      "date": "2025-03-20T14:32:10"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Priority
1. First, create the data aggregation endpoints
2. Then update the chart initialization code
3. Finally, add refresh functionality

## Additional Notes
- The existing multi-signature implementation in `multisig_gateway.py` should be leveraged
- Maintain test mode functionality for development
- Consider paginating large datasets for performance
- Follow the established clean architecture pattern
