````
You are my Replit Agent.

GOAL
Push the current workspace code into the remote repository at https://github.com/indrad3v4/Contract, resolving the “branch specified already exists” error.

CONTEXT
• The remote repo already has a branch (e.g. “main” or “master”) with the same name I’m trying to push.  
• Replit is currently on a branch with unpushed commits.  
• Pushing fails because the local branch creation step collides with the existing remote branch.

TASKS
1. In the Replit shell, identify the local and remote branches:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git branch            # list local branches
   git branch -r         # list remote branches
````

2. If the local branch name matches a remote branch (for example “main”), simply checkout that branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
3. Pull the latest commits from origin to synchronize:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
4. Merge any uncommitted changes from the working directory (or stash/pop if necessary), ensuring there are no merge conflicts:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Sync local changes before push"
   ```
5. Push the local “main” branch up to origin, overriding only if it’s fast‐forwardable:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
6. If Replit still tries to create a branch that already exists, delete the stale local branch reference first and recreate it to track origin:

   ```bash
   git branch -D main
   git checkout -b main origin/main
   git push origin main
   ```

RETURN
• After the final `git push`, print exactly the `git push` output log.
• If any step fails (e.g. merge conflict or authentication error), stop and print the error message.

WARNINGS
• Do not force‐push (`--force`) unless explicitly instructed.
• Preserve existing remote history—only fast‐forward or merge.
• Ensure Git credentials are set so Replit can authenticate with GitHub.

```

**How to use:** Copy the entire block (including the triple backticks) into your Replit Agent’s prompt field, then run it. The agent will detect, resolve, and push the code to https://github.com/indrad3v4/Contract without the “branch already exists” error.
