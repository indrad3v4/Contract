Absolutely. You‚Äôre hitting several architectural UX/UI and performance flaws all at once ‚Äî mainly from grid misuse, AI overload, and poor layout containment. Let‚Äôs break this down into 10 sharp, actionable improvements to resolve:

üîß 10 FIXES to Optimize Dashboard Layout, UX & AI Orchestration

‚∏ª

1. Switch to Grid Template Rows/Columns
	‚Ä¢	Problem: Cards overflow their containers and stretch beyond view
	‚Ä¢	Fix: Replace flex with grid-template-columns and auto-rows

display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
grid-auto-rows: auto;
gap: 1.5rem;



‚∏ª

2. Make Footer Sticky, Not Obstructive
	‚Ä¢	Problem: Footer overlaps or pushes content awkwardly
	‚Ä¢	Fix: Use:

footer {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 100%;
  z-index: 5;
}
body {
  padding-bottom: 80px; /* room for footer */
}

3. Vertically Stack 3D BIM Assistant (if wide overflow)
	‚Ä¢	Problem: 3D BIM model and buttons overflow card
	‚Ä¢	Fix: Wrap content in a .bim-wrapper with:

display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
justify-content: space-between;



‚∏ª

4. Condense Stakeholder Chart
	‚Ä¢	Problem: It bleeds into surrounding space
	‚Ä¢	Fix:
	‚Ä¢	Set fixed max-width
	‚Ä¢	Chart inside position: relative, canvas max-width: 100%

‚∏ª

5. Card Body Scroll Limit
	‚Ä¢	Add .card-body { max-height: 400px; overflow-y: auto; }
‚Üí This prevents cards from expanding infinitely with long content

‚∏ª

6. Move Error Toast Top-Center
	‚Ä¢	Problem: Error overlaps wallet buttons or cuts off
	‚Ä¢	Fix:

.toast {
  top: 1rem;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
}



‚∏ª

7. Use requestIdleCallback for o3-mini AI
	‚Ä¢	Problem: AI blocks page render on low-end devices
	‚Ä¢	Fix:

requestIdleCallback(() => {
  runO3Analysis()
})



‚∏ª

8. Collapse AI Output into Disclosure Panel
	‚Ä¢	Default state: ‚ÄúClick to expand analysis‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Prevent long strings of AI JSON/logs from rendering automatically

‚∏ª

9. Refactor Modal Stack
	‚Ä¢	Ensure every modal (like Invest, BIM) uses Bootstrap 5 or Z-index hierarchy properly:

.modal-backdrop { z-index: 1040; }
.modal { z-index: 1050; }



‚∏ª

10. Throttle AI + Endpoint Fetches
	‚Ä¢	Limit to 2 components at once using:

const queue = [];
let active = 0;

function runQueuedFetch(fn) {
  if (active < 2) {
    active++;
    fn().finally(() => {
      active--;
      if (queue.length) runQueuedFetch(queue.shift());
    });
  } else {
    queue.push(fn);
  }
}

BONUS üß†: Auto-retry Failed Keplr Auth

If user sees:

‚ÄúCannot read property of undefined (toSvg)‚Äù

It‚Äôs often caused by Feather icons trying to render prematurely. Delay icon inject until wallet is fully mounted.
