# DAODISEO GitHub Push Preparation - Clean Architecture + TRIZ Validation

## 1. CLEAN ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION ✅

### Layer Verification
- **Entities**: Core business models properly isolated in domain layer
- **Use Cases**: Business logic centralized without framework dependencies
- **Interface Adapters**: Clean separation between data access and business logic
- **External Interfaces**: UI and API endpoints properly abstracted

### Dependency Rule Compliance
- All dependencies point inward toward entities
- No circular dependencies detected
- Framework-agnostic core business logic
- Proper dependency injection patterns

## 2. TRIZ IDEALIZATION APPLIED ✅

### Combine Operations
- Unified data manager consolidates API calls and caching
- Rate limiting and circuit breaker patterns merged into single system
- Chart data loading and error handling integrated
- Console logging system captures all debugging data

### Eliminate Redundancy
- Removed duplicate API endpoints and services
- Consolidated similar blockchain gateway functions
- Eliminated orphaned test files and stale configurations
- Cleaned up unused imports and variables

### Reprioritize by Criticality
- Core AI orchestration system (highest priority)
- Real-time blockchain data synchronization
- User experience and responsive design
- Security and rate limiting infrastructure

### Human-Centricity Improvements
- Clear variable naming conventions throughout codebase
- Comprehensive documentation and inline comments
- Intuitive component organization and file structure
- User-friendly error messages and feedback

## 3. VALIDATED FOLDER STRUCTURE ✅
